Hello
-----

Hello, my name is Meng and

I'm here to teach the basics of L4,

which is a domain-specific language for law

that's meant to help end-users, in the real world,

better handle the complexity of legal regulations and agreements,

by building a programming language

that humans can write and computers can read

so that web apps and systems like ChatGPT can help end-users deal with
legal situations without having to wade through pages and pages of
legalese.

Audience
--------

I'm going to assume half of you are in law; half of you are in CS; and
if that makes you ask "what about the rest?" you're probably in both
law and CS.

Let me show you why L4 is useful.
---------------------------------

I know, it's 2023, ChatGPT is amazing,

and if you've tried it you've probably been both

impressed with its verbal fluency, and

astonished by the degree to which it can get things totally wrong

and at the same time sound completely confident in what it's making up.

I'm guessing The people at OpenAI knew this was going to happen because they were ready to go with a plugin API. You can use ChatGPT to look up flight information and buy groceries and ask Wolfram questions in math and science.

So you can think of L4 as doing something similar to Wolfram, but instead of math questions it's legal questions.
