===========
Why use L4?
===========

**L4 gives non-lawyers a "low-code" way to *explore* and *produce* legal "programs" --
contracts, legislation, and regulations.**

Some people use L4 to **draft legal templates and automatically
produce legal documents** for signature, using the L4 library.

Enterprise users can integrate L4 into their existing contract
lifecycle management systems to support sophisticated queries.

Governments developing "Rules as Code" can use L4 as to automate the generation of 

.. _viz:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
L4 helps you **explore and understand** complicated legal documents
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To understand complicated **logic** (*and, or, unless*): Rewrite in L4 and view the *decision diagram* to get the big picture. (See: :ref:`eg_mustsing`; Rodent Insurance)

To understand complicated **processes** (*deadlines and obligations*): Rewrite in L4 and view the *state diagram* to see how events change state over time, leading to new obligations for parties.

To understand complicated **rule interactions** (*notwithstanding, subject to*): rewrite in L4 and view the *meta-rule analysis* to see how rules interact.

-----------------------
L4 helps you explore...
-----------------------

You can ask *"what if?"*

Configure a **scenario** with a set of **facts** and **history**. L4 will return an analysis.

You can ask *"why?"*

Drill down into every decision.

-----------------------
L4 gives confidence ...
-----------------------

Using formal methods, L4 analyzes your program for loopholes and inconsistencies.

L4's unit test framework lets you set up test scenarios and monitor them as your contracts evolve.

----------------
A "low-code" DSL
----------------

L4 is a DSL: a **domain-specific language** designed for the legal domain. Some call it "low-code".

--------------------
L4 outputs a diagram
--------------------

L4 generates convenient visualizations of the logic and the moving parts of your "legal program"

Specifying legislation in L4 gives you a diagram that allows you to get from a legal position A to legal position B at a glance.

-------------------------------------
L4 checks for loopholes and conflicts
-------------------------------------

L4 sanity-checks your programs to detect internal conflicts and loopholes.

-----------------------
L4 generates a web tool
-----------------------

L4 automatically generates a web app that helps end users explore the logic of your "legal program".

-------------------------------------------------------
L4's diagram ouput can be converted to multiple formats
-------------------------------------------------------

The diagrammatic output can be converted to a language you need such as Haskell.

------------------------------------
L4 uses spreadsheets for interaction
------------------------------------

L4 uses a spreadsheet interface to allow lawyers to interact with L4 in an environment that they are comfortable in.

-----------------------------
L4 contains a package library
-----------------------------

The L4 package library contains encodings of insurance policies based on those offered by major insurers. 

In addition to contracts, L4's package library also contains encodings of legislation and regulation in the areas of data privacy and building permission.

The available contracts allows you to generate a document you can sign after running it past a lawyer for review.

The L4 package library will soon contain loan agreements, leasing agreements, and investment agreements.
