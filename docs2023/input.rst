Boolean Structures are used in the following positions in larger expressions:

- In constitutive (Hornlike) rules:

  - in the left and right positions of a `DECIDE ... IF ...` pattern, which constructs *Horn Clauses*.

- In regulative rules:

  - following an `IF` keyword.

  - following a `WHO` keyword

Core Semantics: Boolean Logic (quickstart-why-use-L4)
-----------------------------

L4's decision logic is based on Boolean logic. Most programming
languages offer an "if/then/else" construct. The "if" condition is
Boolean-valued. It may rely in turn on numeric or other computation
(e.g. `1024 >= 42`) but the terms reduce to true or false.

L4's basic Boolean operators, borrowed from `propositional logic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus>`_, are:

- `AND`
- `OR`
- `NOT`
- `UNLESS` (merely shorthand -- "syntactic sugar" -- for `AND NOT`)

L4's list-oriented Boolean operators, borrowed from `predicate logic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic>`_, are:

- `ANY`
- `ALL`

Detailed Definition of Boolean Structures
(quickstart-why-use-L4)
-----------------------------------------
    
.. topic: BNF
   
   The BNF for a Boolean Structure is:

.. code-block::

    BoolStruct    a  ::=               UnaBoolStruct a
                         [BinaryBoolOp UnaBoolStruct a]
                         [...]
    BinaryBoolOp     ::= AND | OR | UNLESS
    UnaBoolStruct a  ::= NOT UnaBoolStruct

    a                ::= RelationalPredicate
                       | ParamText

The `a` type is algebraic and in practice is filled by two types: **RelationalPredicates** and **ParamTexts**, described in detail below.
		       
Note that L4 is whitespace-sensitive, so in the first definition
above, the newlines are significant:

.. list-table:: Example of Multiline Boolean Structure

   * - DECIDE
     - output
     - 
   * - IF
     - 
     - foo
   * - IF
     - 
     - foo
   * - AND
     - 
     - bar
   * - OR
     - 
     - baz

The remainder of this section focuses on the elemental
**RelationalPredicates** and **ParamTexts** that can appear within the
Boolean Structure, or **BoolStruct** for short.

                            | NOT     BSE
                            | (Expression)

toToken "NEVER"  = pure Never

toToken "OR" =     pure Or
toToken "AND" =    pure And
toToken "..." =    pure And   -- CNL sugar to allow phrases to follow
toToken "â€¦"   =    pure And   -- CNL sugar to allow phrases to follow -- this is unicode for ellipsis
toToken "UNLESS" = pure Unless
toToken "EXCEPT" = pure Unless
toToken "IF NOT" = pure Unless
toToken "NOT"    = pure MPNot

representing ontology in L4 (classes, instances, methods)
-----------------------------------------
    We use DECLARE to set up our classes, our records, our types, our schemas, our ontology, our templates.

    We use DEFINE to instantiate those templates with concrete values: the specific variables of a particular agreement.

Core Semantics: State Transition Systems (docs\quickstart-why-use-L4.rst)
----------------------------------------

Legislation, regulations, and contracts prescribe processes for
parties to obey: under certain conditions, a person must act in some
way within some deadline; if they succeed, matters proceed one way; if
they fail to act, matters proceed another way.

L4 models these legal and business processes as state transition
systems. Related formalisms include BPMN, DFAs, Petri Nets, and
hierarchical state machines (Harel statecharts).

In L4, regulative, aka prescriptive, rules have the syntax given
below.

.. code-block::

   RegulativeRule      ::= ["UPON"        EventIdentifier]
                            "PARTY"       PartyIdentifier
                           ["IF"          ConditionExpression]
		            DeonticModal     ActionExpression
		           [TemporalModal  DeadlineExpression]
		           [SuccessTransition]
		           [FailureTransition]
		           ["WHERE"       LetBinding]
		      
   EventIdentifier     ::= ParamText
		      
   PartyIdentifier     ::= BoolStruct of ParamText
		      
   ConditionExpression ::= BoolStruct of Relational Predicates
   		      
   DeonticModal        ::= "MUST" | "MAY" | "SHANT"
		      
   ActionExpression    ::= BoolStruct of ParamText
		      
   TemporalModal       ::= "BEFORE" | "AFTER" | "BY" | "ON"
   
   DeadlineExpression  ::= Number ("days" | "weeks" | "months" | "years")
                         | AbsoluteDate

   SuccessTransition   ::= ("THUS" | "HENCE" | "IF FULFILLED") (RuleName | RegulativeRule)

   LetBinding          ::= DecisionRule+

   RuleName            ::= String

The syntax for a `DecisionRule` is given below.

AbsoluteDate syntax is not given here, this is a can of worms to be
explored elsewhere.
   
This syntax is intended to maintain isomorphism with legal source text
which frequently has the form "upon receiving a demand for repayment,
if the borrower is in default, the borrower must repay the outstanding
principal plus any applicable accrued interest to the lender within
five business days."

Under the hood, that English text is trying to express a state
transition. The L4 reorganizes the parts of the sentence according to
a standard format.

.. code-block:: L4

     UPON  demand for repayment
       IF  borrower  IS  in default
    PARTY  borrower
     MUST  repay  the loan amount
              to  the lender
   WITHIN  5  business days
    WHERE  DECIDE  the loan amount  IS  SUM  outstanding principal
                                             any applicable accrued interest

Double-spaces indicate column separations.

   In a state transition system, events occur in time, changing the
   *current state* to some *next state*. States lead one to another,
   in a directed acyclic graph. They terminate in one of (usually) two
   states: fulfilled, vs breach. In renewable contracts there may be a
   third "final" state which is shorthand for "restart the contract at
   some earlier state, but with certain variables updated, such as
   expiration date."

Concurrency presents a conceptual challenge. Many contracts and
business processes describe multiple "moving parts". If you're
juggling balls with your right hand while spinning plates with your
left, each hand can be naturally modeled as its own state machine; but
showing the system as a whole requires a product composition of every
state on the left with every state on the right. L4's treatment of
this issue is given elsewhere in this documentation.
